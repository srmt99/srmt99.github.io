                My current focus is in the area of <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, and how it can be combined with other areas in order to achieve
                practical results.
                I am now working on ways we can apply RL methods in environments where the specifications are defined by <strong>linear temporal logics</strong> ,
                and arrive at a policy for the system where these requirements are met.<br>
                I would describe myself as someone who loves his field of study and is always eager to learn more.<br>
                My general interest is in the field of <strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> and its applications.
                I am especially interested in Reinforcement Learning, and how it can be used in real world problems.
                I am genuinely intrigued by the way "<strong>learning</strong>" works, and It's my dream and ambition
                to contribute my small share to achieving strong AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                Starting around 2019, I have been trying to learn as much as I can about AI both inside and outside the university.
                I have passed several AI-related courses, all with A's, and have practiced this knowledge in a number of
                <a onclick="show_projects()" class="non_underline-link blue-btn projects" href="#" >projects</a>.
                I ranked 19 out of 30k students (top 0.07%) in our national university entrance exam and was announced as an outstanding student
                by Amirkabir University of Technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                My primary goal is to continue my studies and conduct research as a member of an enthusiastic team. This, I hope, would give me 		the academic background that I need to be knowledgeable in my field and successful in my future career.
